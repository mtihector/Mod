The project aims to help me; and anyone else; to build modules in top of it, for my projects, usually those are **private web applications**.

## DISCLAIMER

The code written by me is being distributed under MIT License.

Libraries like JQuery, EF, etc. are work from other developers and the credit is to them also they got their own license to be use, right now everyone use MIT and its included in it source or in the installation folder.

I include the Javascript libraries becouse i don't like the path where nuget install them, when i got the time to implement something to take care of the installation path the way i like it, i will make the update.
