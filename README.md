# Modular Web Application with .NET 

This is a infrastructure project to make a modular web application in top of it.

The project aims to help me; and anyone else; giving me a platform where i can build any module in top of it, for my projects, usually those are ** private web applications **.

Also i use this to write in my [blog](http://www.mtihector.com) about how i built this kind of applications.

You can contact [me](mailto:contact@mtihector.com).





## DISCLAIMER

The part of the code wrote by me is distributed under MIT License.

I use some libraries in the way i think is the best in my opinion. This is **not** the opinion of any of the libraries authors.

Libraries like JQuery, EF, etc. are work from others and its credit to them also thay got their own license to be use.

I include the Javascript libraries becouse i don't like the path where nuget install them, when i got the time to implement something to take care of the installation path the way i like it, i will make the update.

I'm not work for any of those companies i promote it use as a happy user of them nothing more.
